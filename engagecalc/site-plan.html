      <h2>Overview</h2>
      <h3>Purpose</h3>
      <p>
        This site will help people plan the classes they want their characters
        to go into by giving them all of the necessary information to make
        informed decisions.
      </p>

      <h3>Audience</h3>
      <p>
        The target audience is the playerbase for the game, Fire Emblem Engage.
      </p>

      <h3>Dynamic elements</h3>
      <p>
        All of the characters from Fire Emblem Engage will be converted into
        objects to be added dynamically to the page. Potential classes for the
        characters will also be objects. Additionally, the weapon icon below the 
        dropdown boxes will change based on the class and its available weapon types.
        Users will be able to select a character and their desired class to receive 
        the combined growths for each stat.

      <h2>Content</h2>
      <h3>Home page: Growths Calculator</h3>
      <p>
        Text content: "Each character has a chance to increase one of their stats when they level up; this is called a growth.
        Classes also have their own respective growths. These are added to a character's base growths if they belong to that class.
        This calculator will help you determine what classes to put your units into. Generally speaking, a growth of over 50% in a key stat 
        (such as STR/MAG, DEF/RES, or SPD) is considered to be good. A 50% growth in a stat means that, on average, the character will increase that 
        stat by one every two level ups. However, key stats vary based on the class and its role in your army."
        <p>"Please select a character and/or class to receive their total growths."</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Characters dropdown name & growths</li>
          <li>Character details (ex: recruitment chapter, emblem/class synergies)</li>
          <li>Classes dropdown name & growths</li>
          <li>Weapon icons</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h3>[Page 2]: Character Search</h3>
      <p>
        Text content: "Use this page to search for specific characters."
        <p>"Note: Emblems are also included in this list, but they are marked with an asterisk to indicate they are not directly 
          playable. Only their names will appear in the list because they do not have growths."</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Character names</li>
          <li>Emblem names</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <h2>Wireframes</h2>
      <p>
        Create two wireframes for your site. One for each page and list them
        here 
        <ul>
          <li>Home page: https://wireframe.cc/hovv3y</li>
          <li>Character search: https://wireframe.cc/vlcLTJ</li>
        </ul>
      </p>

      <h3>Home Page: Engage Calculator</h3>
      <p>
        The placeholder image below the dropdown boxes will be a different weapon icon, based on the class's wieldable weapon types.
